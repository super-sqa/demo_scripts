# demo_scripts

A collection of scripts that do different random things. To be used in courses and tutorials to show examples of scripts, cicd pipelines, git flows, ... and more.

## About

This repository contains simple Python scripts that generate various outputs (console messages, files, reports). Each script is intentionally basic to focus on demonstrating tools and processes rather than complex logic.

## Purpose

These scripts serve as examples for demonstrating:
- Jenkins job configurations
- Pipeline creation
- Git workflows
- Build processes
- Artifact handling
- Directory management
- Basic automation

## Note

This is a demonstration repository. All scripts are designed for learning purposes and to show practical examples in tutorials and courses. More scripts and examples will be added over time.
